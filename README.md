# Graph-Implementations

This repo contains an interface for a generic Graph and has implementations for an undirected, unweighted graph and a directed, weighted graph in GraphImpl.java. 
Just provide a boolean to determine which type of graph you want to use, true for a directed, weighted graph, false for an undirected, unweighted graph.
